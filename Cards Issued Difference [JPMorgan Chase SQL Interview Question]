Your team at JPMorgan Chase is preparing to launch a new credit card, and to gain some insights, you're analyzing how many credit cards were issued each month.

Write a query that outputs the name of each credit card and the difference in the number of issued cards between the month with the highest issuance cards and the lowest issuance. Arrange the results based on the largest disparity.

monthly_cards_issued Table:
Column Name	Type
card_name	string
issued_amount	integer
issue_month	integer
issue_year	integer
monthly_cards_issued Example Input:
card_name	issued_amount	issue_month	issue_year
Chase Freedom Flex	55000	1	2021
Chase Freedom Flex	60000	2	2021
Chase Freedom Flex	65000	3	2021
Chase Freedom Flex	70000	4	2021
Chase Sapphire Reserve	170000	1	2021
Chase Sapphire Reserve	175000	2	2021
Chase Sapphire Reserve	180000	3	2021
Example Output:
card_name	difference
Chase Freedom Flex	15000
Chase Sapphire Reserve	10000
Chase Freedom Flex's best month was 70k cards issued and the worst month was 55k cards, so the difference is 15k cards.

Chase Sapphire Reserveâ€™s best month was 180k cards issued and the worst month was 170k cards, so the difference is 10k cards.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

WITH CTE AS (
  SELECT card_name, MAX(issued_amount), MIN(issued_amount)
  FROM monthly_cards_issued
  GROUP BY card_name)
  

SELECT card_name, (max-min) AS difference
FROM CTE
ORDER BY card_name DESC;
