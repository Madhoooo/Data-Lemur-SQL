Assume you're given a table Twitter tweet data, write a query to obtain a histogram of tweets posted per user in 2022. Output the tweet count per user as the bucket and the number of Twitter users who fall into that bucket.

In other words, group the users by the number of tweets they posted in 2022 and count the number of users in each group.

tweets Table:
Column Name	Type
tweet_id	integer
user_id	integer
msg	string
tweet_date	timestamp
tweets Example Input:
tweet_id	user_id	msg	tweet_date
214252	111	Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.	12/30/2021 00:00:00
739252	111	Despite the constant negative press covfefe	01/01/2022 00:00:00
846402	111	Following @NickSinghTech on Twitter changed my life!	02/14/2022 00:00:00
241425	254	If the salary is so competitive why wonâ€™t you tell me what it is?	03/01/2022 00:00:00
231574	148	I no longer have a manager. I can't be managed	03/23/2022 00:00:00
Example Output:
tweet_bucket	users_num
1	2
2	1
Explanation:
Based on the example output, there are two users who posted only one tweet in 2022, and one user who posted two tweets in 2022. The query groups the users by the number of tweets they posted and displays the number of users in each group.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

*** SOLUTION***

WITH CTE AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id AS user_num,
    COUNT(tweet_id) AS tweet_count
  FROM 
    tweets
  WHERE 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM tweet_date) = 2022
  GROUP BY 
    user_id
),

ONE AS (
  SELECT 
    tweet_count,
    COUNT(user_num) AS user_count
  FROM 
    CTE
  GROUP BY 
    tweet_count
)

SELECT 
  tweet_count AS tweet_bucket, 
  user_count
FROM 
  ONE
ORDER BY 
  tweet_count;
