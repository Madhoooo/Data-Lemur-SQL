Imagine you're an HR analyst at a tech company tasked with analyzing employee salaries. Your manager is keen on understanding the pay distribution and asks you to determine the second highest salary among all employees.

It's possible that multiple employees may share the same second highest salary. In case of duplicate, display the salary only once.

employees Schema:
column_name	type	description
employee_id	integer	The unique ID of the employee.
salary	integer	The salary of the employee.
employees Example Input:
employee_id	salary
1	2500
2	800
3	1000
Example Output:
second_highest_salary
1000
The output represents the second highest salary among all employees. In this case, the second highest salary is $1,000.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

*** SOLUTION ***

WITH CTE AS (
  SELECT *,
  RANK()OVER( ORDER BY salary DESC) as rnk
  FROM employees
  ORDER BY salary DESC)
  

SELECT salary AS second_highest_salary
FROM CTE 
WHERE rnk =2;
