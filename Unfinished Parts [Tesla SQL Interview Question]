Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query to determine which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

Assumptions:

parts_assembly table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.
An unfinished part is one that lacks a finish_date.
This question is straightforward, so let's approach it with simplicity in both thinking and solution.

Effective April 11th 2023, the problem statement and assumptions were updated to enhance clarity.

parts_assembly Table
Column Name	Type
part	string
finish_date	datetime
assembly_step	integer
parts_assembly Example Input
part	finish_date	assembly_step
battery	01/22/2022 00:00:00	1
battery	02/22/2022 00:00:00	2
battery	03/22/2022 00:00:00	3
bumper	01/22/2022 00:00:00	1
bumper	02/22/2022 00:00:00	2
bumper		3
bumper		4
Example Output
part	assembly_step
bumper	3
bumper	4
Explanation
The bumpers in step 3 and 4 are the only item that remains unfinished as it lacks a recorded finish date.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

*** SOLUTION ***

SELECT part, assembly_step
FROM parts_assembly
WHERE finish_date IS NULL;
