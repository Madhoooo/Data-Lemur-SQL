You're trying to find the mean number of items per order on Alibaba, rounded to 1 decimal place using tables which includes information on the count of items in each order (item_count table) and the corresponding number of orders for each item count (order_occurrences table).
items_per_order Table:
Column Name	Type
item_count	integer
order_occurrences	integer
items_per_order Example Input:
item_count	order_occurrences
1	500
2	1000
3	800
4	1000
There are a total of 500 orders with one item per order, 1000 orders with two items per order, and 800 orders with three items per order."

Example Output:
mean
2.7
Explanation
Let's calculate the arithmetic average:

Total items = (1*500) + (2*1000) + (3*800) + (4*1000) = 8900

Total orders = 500 + 1000 + 800 + 1000 = 3300

Mean = 8900 / 3300 = 2.7

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!


**** SOLUTION *****





WITH CTE AS (
  SELECT item_count, order_occurrences, (item_count * order_occurrences) AS mul
  FROM items_per_order
),
ONE AS (
  SELECT SUM(order_occurrences) AS Total_orders, SUM(mul) AS Total_items, 
         ROUND(CAST(SUM(mul) AS NUMERIC) / CAST(SUM(order_occurrences) AS NUMERIC), 1) AS Mean
  FROM CTE
)
SELECT Mean FROM ONE;
