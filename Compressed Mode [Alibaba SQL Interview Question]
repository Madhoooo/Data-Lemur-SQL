You're given a table containing the item count for each order on Alibaba, along with the frequency of orders that have the same item count. Write a query to retrieve the mode of the order occurrences. Additionally, if there are multiple item counts with the same mode, the results should be sorted in ascending order.

Clarifications:

item_count: Represents the number of items sold in each order.
order_occurrences: Represents the frequency of orders with the corresponding number of items sold per order.
For example, if there are 800 orders with 3 items sold in each order, the record would have an item_count of 3 and an order_occurrences of 800.
Effective June 14th, 2023, the problem statement has been revised and additional clarification have been added for clarity.

items_per_order Table:
Column Name	Type
item_count	integer
order_occurrences	integer
items_per_order Example Input:
item_count	order_occurrences
1	500
2	1000
3	800
Example Output:
mode
2
Explanation:
Based on the example output, the order_occurrences value of 1000 corresponds to the highest frequency among all item counts. This means that item count of 2 has occurred 1000 times, making it the mode of order occurrences.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!

Hint #1

The mode represents the value with the highest frequency or the most common number of order occurrences.

To find the mode of order occurrences, you can utilize the MAX() function in your query. This function retrieves the maximum value present in the order_occurrences field.

SELECT MAX(_____)
FROM items_per_order;


*** SOLUTION ****

WITH CTE AS (
  SELECT * 
  FROM items_per_order
  WHERE order_occurrences = 1000)


SELECT item_count AS mode FROM CTE;
