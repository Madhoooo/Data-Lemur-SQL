Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

posts Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
post_id	integer
post_content	text
post_date	timestamp
posts Example Input:
user_id	post_id	post_content	post_date
151652	599415	Need a hug	07/10/2021 12:00:00
661093	624356	Bed. Class 8-12. Work 12-3. Gym 3-5 or 6. Then class 6-10. Another day that's gonna fly by. I miss my girlfriend	07/29/2021 13:00:00

Example Output:
user_id	days_between
151652	2
661093	21

*** SOLUTION***

WITH CTE AS (
  SELECT user_id, post_id, post_date, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM post_date) AS year
  FROM posts
  WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM post_date) = 2021
    AND user_id IN (
      SELECT user_id
      FROM posts
      WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM post_date) = 2021
      GROUP BY user_id
      HAVING COUNT(post_id) > 1
    )
),
ONE AS (
  SELECT *,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY post_date) AS rnk
  FROM CTE
),

TWO AS (
  SELECT user_id, post_id,post_date,
         LAG(post_date, 2) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY post_date) AS lag_func
  FROM ONE)
  
SELECT user_id ,EXTRACT(DAYS FROM(post_date-lag_func)) AS days_between
FROM TWO
WHERE lag_func IS NOT NULL;
